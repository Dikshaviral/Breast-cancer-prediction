# Breast-cancer-prediction

On the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset (WBCD) we applied five main algorithms which are: SVM, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-NN, calculate, compare and evaluate different results obtained based on confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, precision, AUC to identify the best machine learning algorithm that are precise, reliable and find the higher accuracy. All algorithms have been programmed in Python using scikit-learn library in Anaconda environment.
